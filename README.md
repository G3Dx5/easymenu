# easymenu
Easy python3 menu for projects.  Just put your function (or import your function) to the function calls within the script.  There are nominal functions already in the script to guide the user where to add their content.  They simply are a print statement used as a marker to tell you where to look. The print statement corresponds to the number in the menu. Replace as you like, get used to where they are  and enjoy!

To Do: 

Fix routine if user enters a letter as opposed to an integer.
